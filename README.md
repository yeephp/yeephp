YeePHP is a framework designed with Web Developers in mind, without overwhelming your Apps or API Projects with overheads which reflect in the performance of your final product. https://yeephp.com

YeePHP is not further supported. We decided shortly to publish a new Framework, used in a variety of new(er) projects, with even improved performance, and fully optimised for cloud deployments. Read and follow us at https://codecoda.com/en
